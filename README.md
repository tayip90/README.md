Hello there, I'm Tayip 👋

I'm an enthusiastic individual driven by a strong desire for self-improvement and a hunger for valuable experiences in the tech world.

My heart beats for the realm of information technology, and I'm constantly honing my skills to reach new heights every day.

Embracing the path of a self-learner, I'm always on the lookout for fresh learning opportunities, eager to evolve and adapt to any challenge that crosses my path.

🔭 Currently, I'm an active participant in the Ctrl+Future Program, a transformative collaboration between Koç Holding and Microsoft.

🌱 I'm deepening my understanding of algorithms, data structures, databases, and scrum techniques, all thanks to the enlightening journey with Patika.dev.

🏫 I'm pursuing a degree in MIS (Management Information Systems) at Boğaziçi University, and I'm currently in my senior year, ready to take on new horizons.

Languages at an Intermediate Level:  SQL, Python
